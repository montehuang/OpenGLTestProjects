Note that:
1. All light pos transform/scale/rotate in same space(world-space or view-space)
2. Watch out the viewer direction and light direction in specular lighting.
3. Gouraud shading is change light color in Vertex shader and pass to fragment shader
   but the color values of the surrounding fragments are then the result of interpolated
   lighting color.
